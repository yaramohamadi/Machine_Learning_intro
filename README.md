# Machine_Learning_intro

:) سلام دوستان

This is the material used in my free Persian machine learning with python course available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgw1zjj8fyc&list=PL2_W-QFuPimVkqWnFnSf-kOWtrGs1avpO&index=1&t=18s). 

This 2 hours long course offers a practical introduction into Machine Learning with Python. 
this course is for you if you are familiar with data analytics libraries in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) and looking for a hands-on introduction to machine learning.
After finishing this course, you will grasp the basic concepts in machine learning and be able to use machine learning techniques on any data with Scikit-Learn, the most commonly used library for machine learning in python.

## Note
The notebook cells are oddly aligned horizontally when rendered on GitHub. I have not found the solution to this problem unfortunately. However, they are correctly aligned when rendered on Jupyter, so I recommend downloading th notebook files and opening them with Jupyter or Colab or similar IDEs.
