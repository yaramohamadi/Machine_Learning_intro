# Machine_Learning_intro

:) سلام دوستان

This is the material used in my free Persian course: Machine Learning with Python (available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgw1zjj8fyc&list=PL2_W-QFuPimVkqWnFnSf-kOWtrGs1avpO&index=1&t=18s)). 

This 2 hours long course offers a practical introduction into Machine Learning with Python. 
this course is for you if you are familiar with data analytics libraries in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) and you are looking for a hands-on introduction to Machine Learning.
After finishing this course, you will grasp the basic concepts in Machine Learning and be able to use its techniques on any data with Scikit-Learn, the most commonly used library for Machine Learning in Python.

## Note
Oddly, the notebook cells are horizontally aligned when rendered on GitHub. I haven't found the solution to this problem unfortunately. However, they are correctly aligned when rendered on Jupyter, so I recommend downloading the notebook files and opening them with Jupyter or Colab or similar IDEs.
